            <h2>1. Environmental Benefits</h2>

            <h2>2. Lower Operating Costs</h2>
            <p>Electric vehicles are generally cheaper to maintain than traditional gasoline cars. They have fewer moving parts and do not require oil changes.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Energy Efficiency</h2>
            <p>Electric cars are more energy-efficient than their gasoline counterparts, converting a higher percentage of electrical energy from the grid to power at the wheels.</p>

            <h2>4. Quiet Operation</h2>
            <p>EVs operate quietly, providing a more pleasant driving experience and reducing noise pollution in urban areas.</p>
