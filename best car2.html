            <h1>Essential Car Maintenance Tips</h1>
            <p>Maintaining your vehicle is crucial for its longevity and performance. Here are some essential tips to keep your car in top shape:</p>

            <h2>1. Regular Oil Changes</h2>
            <p>Changing your oil regularly ensures that your engine runs smoothly. Check your owner's manual for the recommended oil change intervals.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Tire Maintenance</h2>
            <p>Keep your tires properly inflated and check their tread depth regularly. Rotate your tires every 6,000 to 8,000 miles to ensure even wear.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Brake Checks</h2>
            <p>Inspect your brakes regularly for any signs of wear. Listen for unusual sounds and have your brake pads checked if you notice any issues.</p>

            <h2>4. Fluid Levels</h2>
            <p>Regularly check the fluid levels in your car, including coolant, brake fluid, and transmission fluid. Top them off as necessary to avoid performance issues.</p>

            <h2>5. Battery Care</h2>
            <p>Inspect your battery terminals for corrosion and ensure a secure connection. Replace the battery every 3-5 years to avoid breakdowns.</p>
